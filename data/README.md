# 2sh_wf/
Results from simulations of two serial homologs with conserved identities in Wrigh-Fisher (WF) populations.

## out_1t/
Results of simulations where only one serial homolog is under directional selection while the other is under stabilizing selection.

## out_div/
Results of simulations where two serial homologs are under divergent selection.

## out_concordant/
Results of simulations where two serial homologs are under concordant selection.

## out_stab/
Results of simulations where both serial homologs are under stabilizing selection.

## File name structure
Files have two types of with name formats:
"sim_out_end_<optimum_of_serial_homolog_1>_<optimum_of_serial_homolog_1>_<number_of_targets_shared_by_IDGs>_<correlational_selection_coefficient>.txt" (output at the end of simulations)
and
"sim_out_all_<optimum_of_serial_homolog_1>_<optimum_of_serial_homolog_1>_<number_of_targets_shared_by_IDGs>_<correlational_selection_coefficient>.txt" (simulation output over time)
