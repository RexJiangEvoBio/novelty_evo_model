This folder contains SLiM code used to simulate evolution.

# slim_2sh_wf.txt
Used to simulate 2 coevolving serial homologs with conserved identities in Wright-Fisher (WF) populations.

# slim_2sh_nwf.txt
Used to simulate 2 coevolving serial homologs with conserved identities in non-WF populations.

# slim_id_wf.txt
Used to simulate a character with changing identity in WF populations.

# slim_id_nwf.txt
Used to simulate a character with changing identity in non-WF populations.
